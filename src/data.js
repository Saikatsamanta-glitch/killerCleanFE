The cleaners will need to have access to surfaces to clean and if they are covered up by too much clutter they may be inaccessible. Make sure the floors are clear of items and debris. Communicate with your cleaner when they arrive (if you are home) a plan to make sure the cleaner has space to clean. Children, pets and other adults in the way can really hinder a job from being done in the best way possible. It can also be hazardous. Vacuum cords, cleaning products and supplies will be in the area with the cleaner and to mitigate accidents from happening it is best to give them space. If you have any questions about how to better prepare, feel free to reach out and ask any questions at all!",
