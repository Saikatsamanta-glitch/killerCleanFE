          <p className="mb-4">
            Confirmation. When booking a cleaning service online, you understand
            that it does not automatically guarantee a customer an appointment
            for that day and time. When booking, scheduling conflicts may occur.
            One of our representatives will contact you by email or by phone
            with a confirmation for your appointment.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            In order for our Company to keep prices low and avoid trip fees, we
            schedule our cleanings in an order that requires the least amount of
            driving time. If you need a specific time, we will do our best to
            meet your needs, but we cannot make any guarantees.
          </p>

          <p className="mb-4">
            The Customer is expected to be on premises at the time of our
            representative’s arrival unless previous arrangements have been made
            with a security code and key.
          </p>

            Our Company reserves the right to refuse or discontinue service at
            any time and for any reason to protect our Company, subcontractors,

            You understand that our subcontractors and agents have the option to
            leave the premises if the area is in an exceedingly unclean state;
            if they feel intimidated, unsafe, or endangered. If our
            subcontractor or agent cancels a scheduled cleaning due to any of
            the above reasons, you understand and agree that you will be charged
            a $100.00 cancellation fee.

            24 Hour Notice. We require a minimum of 24-hour notice if you need
            to cancel or reschedule your cleaning appointment to avoid a $100.00
            cancellation fee. Customers must provide notice via email or by

            result in a $100.00 cancellation fee charged to the Customer’s
            credit card on file. If the Customer cancels service in less than 24
            hours, a $100.00 cancellation fee applies.

          <p>
            This Agreement shall be governed by and construed in accordance with

            provisions.

            If any clause or paragraph in this agreement is considered
            unenforceable or invalid under any law or statute or made invalid by
            an Order of a Court of law, the invalid or unenforceable clause
            shall not render the balance of this Agreement invalid. Any invalid
            provision shall be considered altered and interpreted so it does not
            affect the rest of this agreement.
